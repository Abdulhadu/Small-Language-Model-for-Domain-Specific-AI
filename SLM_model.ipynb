The\\naccessibility of these models has lagged behind\\ntheir performance. State-of-the-art LLMs re-\\nquire costly infrastructure; are only accessible\\nvia rate-limited, geo-locked, and censored web\\ninterfaces; and lack publicly available code and\\ntechnical reports.\\nIn this paper, we tell the story of GPT4All, a\\npopular open source repository that aims to\\ndemocratize access to LLMs. We outline the\\ntechnical details of the original GPT4All model\\nfamily, as well as the evolution of the GPT4All\\nproject from a single model into a fully fledged\\nopen source ecosystem. It is our hope that\\nthis paper acts as both a technical overview of\\nthe original GPT4All models as well as a case\\nstudy on the subsequent growth of the GPT4All\\nopen source ecosystem.\\n1 Introduction\\nOn March 14 2023, OpenAI released GPT-4, a large\\nlanguage model capable of achieving human level per-\\nformance on a variety of professional and academic\\nbenchmarks. Despite the popularity of the release,\\nthe GPT-4 technical report (OpenAI, 2023) contained\\nvirtually no details regarding the architecture, hard-\\nware, training compute, dataset construction, or training\\nmethod used to create the model. Moreover, users could\\nonly access the model through the internet interface at\\nchat.openai.com, which was severely rate limited and\\nunavailable in several locales (e.g. Italy) (BBC News,\\n2023). Additionally, GPT-4 refused to answer a wide\\n∗ Shared Senior Authorship\\nvariety of queries, responding only with the now infa-\\nmous \"As an AI Language Model, I cannot...\" prefix\\n(Vincent, 2023). These transparency and accessibility\\nconcerns spurred several developers to begin creating\\nopen source large language model (LLM) alternatives.\\nSeveral grassroots efforts focused on fine tuning Meta’s\\nopen code LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023; McMil-\\nlan, 2023), whose weights were leaked on BitTorrent\\nless than a week prior to the release of GPT-4 (Verge,\\n2023). GPT4All started as one of these variants.\\nIn this paper, we tell the story of GPT4All. We com-\\nment on the technical details of the original GPT4All\\nmodel (Anand et al., 2023), as well as the evolution of\\nGPT4All from a single model to an ecosystem of several\\nmodels. We remark on the impact that the project has\\nhad on the open source community, and discuss future\\ndirections. It is our hope that this paper acts as both a\\ntechnical overview of the original GPT4All models as\\nwell as a case study on the subsequent growth of the\\nGPT4All open source ecosystem.\\n2 The Original GPT4All Model\\n2.1 Data Collection and Curation\\nTo train the original GPT4All model, we collected\\nroughly one million prompt-response pairs using the\\nGPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI API between March 20, 2023\\nand March 26th, 2023. In particular, we gathered GPT-\\n3.5-Turbo responses to prompts of three publicly avail-\\nable datasets: the unified chip2 subset of LAION OIG,\\na random sub-sample of Stackoverflow Questions, and\\na sub-sample of Bigscience/P3 (Sanh et al., 2021). Fol-\\nlowing the approach in Stanford Alpaca (Taori et al.,\\n2023), an open source LLaMA variant that came just be-\\nfore GPT4All, we focused substantial effort on dataset\\ncuration.\\nThe collected dataset was loaded into Atlas (AI,\\n2023)—a visual interface for exploring and tagging mas-\\nsive unstructured datasets —for data curation. Using At-\\narXiv:2311.04931v1  [cs.CL]  6 Nov 2023 las, we identified and removed subsets of the data where\\nGPT-3.5-Turbo refused to respond, had malformed out-\\nput, or produced a very short response. This resulted in\\nthe removal of the entire Bigscience/P3 subset of our\\ndata, as many P3 prompts induced responses that were\\nsimply one word. After curation, we were left with a set\\nof 437,605 prompt-response pairs, which we visualize\\nin Figure 1a.\\n2.2 Model Training\\nThe original GPT4All model was a fine tuned variant\\nof LLaMA 7B. In order to train it more efficiently, we\\nfroze the base weights of LLaMA, and only trained a\\nsmall set of LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) weights during the\\nfine tuning process. Detailed model hyper-parameters\\nand training code can be found in our associated code\\nrepository1.\\n2.3 Model Access\\nWe publicly released all data, training code, and model\\nweights for the community to build upon. Further, we\\nprovided a 4-bit quantized version of the model, which\\nenabled users to run it on their own commodity hard-\\nware without transferring data to a 3rd party service.\\nOur research and development costs were dominated\\nby ∼$800 in GPU spend (rented from Lambda Labs and\\nPaperspace) and ∼$500 in OpenAI API spend. Our final\\nGPT4All model could be trained in about eight hours\\non a Lambda Labs DGX A100 8x 80GB for a total cost\\nof ∼$100.\\n2.4 Model Evaluation\\nWe performed a preliminary evaluation of our model\\nusing the human evaluation data from the Self Instruct\\npaper (Wang et al., 2023). We reported the ground truth\\nperplexity of our model against what was, to our knowl-\\nedge, the best openly available alpaca-lora model at the\\ntime, provided by user chainyo on HuggingFace. Both\\nmodels had very large perplexities on a small number of\\ntasks, so we reported perplexities clipped to a maximum\\nof 100. We found that GPT4All produces stochastically\\nlower ground truth perplexities than alpaca-lora (Anand\\net al., 2023).\\n3 From a Model to an Ecosystem\\n3.1 GPT4All-J: Repository Growth and the\\nimplications of the LLaMA License\\nThe GPT4All repository grew rapidly after its release,\\ngaining over 20000 GitHub stars in just one week, as\\nshown in Figure 2. This growth was supported by an\\nin-person hackathon hosted in New York City three days\\nafter the model release, which attracted several hundred\\nparticipants. As the Nomic discord, the home of online\\ndiscussion about GPT4All, ballooned to over 10000\\npeople, one thing became very clear - there was massive\\ndemand for a model that could be used commercially.\\n1https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all\\nThe LLaMA model that GPT4All was based on was\\nlicensed for research only, which severely limited the\\nset of domains that GPT4All could be applied in. As\\na response to this, the Nomic team repeated the model\\ntraining procedure of the original GPT4All model, but\\nbased on the already open source and commercially li-\\ncensed GPT-J model (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021).\\nGPT4All-J also had an augmented training set, which\\ncontained multi-turn QA examples and creative writing\\nsuch as poetry, rap, and short stories. The creative writ-\\ning prompts were generated by filling in schemas such\\nas \"Write a [CREATIVE STORY TYPE] about [NOUN]\\nin the style of [PERSON].\" We again employed Atlas\\nto curate the prompt-response pairs in this data set.\\nOur evaluation methodology also evolved as the\\nproject grew. In particular, we began evaluating\\nGPT4All models using a suite of seven reasoning\\ntasks that were used for evaluation of the Databricks\\nDolly (Conover et al., 2023b) model, which was re-\\nleased on April 12, 2023. Unfortunately, GPT4All-J did\\nnot outperform other prominent open source models on\\nthis evaluation. As a result, we endeavoured to create a\\nmodel that did.\\n3.2 GPT4All-Snoozy: the Emergence of the\\nGPT4All Ecosystem\\nGPT4All-Snoozy was developed using roughly the same\\nprocedure as the previous GPT4All models, but with a\\nfew key modifications. First, GPT4All-Snoozy used the\\nLLaMA-13B base model due to its superior base metrics procedure as the previous GPT4All models, but with a\\nfew key modifications. First, GPT4All-Snoozy used the\\nLLaMA-13B base model due to its superior base metrics\\nwhen compared to GPT-J. Next, GPT4All-Snoozy incor-\\nporated the Dolly’s training data into its train mix. After\\ndata curation and deduplication with Atlas, this yielded\\na training set of 739,259 total prompt-response pairs.\\nWe dubbed the model that resulted from training on this\\nimproved dataset GPT4All-Snoozy. As shown in Figure\\n1, GPT4All-Snoozy had the best average score on our\\nevaluation benchmark of any model in the ecosystem at\\nthe time of its release.\\nConcurrently with the development of GPT4All, sev-\\neral organizations such as LMSys, Stability AI, BAIR,\\nand Databricks built and deployed open source language\\nmodels. We heard increasingly from the community that\\nthey wanted quantized versions of these models for local\\nuse. As we realized that organizations with ever more\\nresources were developing source language models, we\\ndecided to pivot our effort away from training increas-\\ningly capable models and towards providing easy access\\nto the plethora of models being produced by the open\\nsource community. Practically, this meant spending our\\ntime compressing open source models for use on com-\\nmodity hardware, providing stable and simple high level\\nmodel APIs, and supporting a GUI for no code model\\nexperimentation.\\n3.3 The Current State of GPT4All\\nToday, GPT4All is focused on improving the accessi-\\nbility of open source language models. The repository (a)\\n (b)\\n (c)\\n (d)\\nFigure 1: TSNE visualizations showing the progression of the GPT4All train set. Panel (a) shows the original\\nuncurated data.

The project continues to increase in\\npopularity, and as of August 1 2023, has garnered over\\n50000 GitHub stars and over 5000 forks.\\nGPT4All currently provides native support and\\nbenchmark data for over 35 models (see Figure 1), and\\nincludes several models co-developed with industry part-\\nners such as Replit and Hugging Face. GPT4All also\\nprovides high level model APIs in languages includ-\\ning Python, Typescript, Go, C#, and Java, among oth-\\ners. Furthermore, the GPT4All no code GUI currently\\nsupports the workflows of over 50000 monthly active\\nusers, with over 25% of users coming back to the tool\\nevery day of the week. (Note that all GPT4All user\\ndata is collected on an opt inbasis.) GPT4All has be-\\ncome the top language model integration in the popular\\nopen source AI orchestration library LangChain (Chase,\\n2022), and powers many popular open source projects\\nsuch as PrivateGPT (imartinez, 2023), Quiver (StanGi-\\nrard, 2023), and MindsDB (MindsDB, 2023), among\\nothers. GPT4All is the 3rd fastest growing GitHub\\nrepository of all time (Leo, 2023), and is the 185th most\\npopular repository on the platform, by star count.\\n4 The Future of GPT4All\\nIn the future, we will continue to grow GPT4All, sup-\\nporting it as the de facto solution for LLM accessibil-\\nity. Concretely, this means continuing to compress and\\ndistribute important open-source language models de-\\nveloped by the community, as well as compressing and\\ndistributing increasingly multimodal AI models. Fur-\\nthermore, we will expand the set of hardware devices\\nthat GPT4All models run on, so that GPT4All models\\n“just work\" on any machine, whether it comes equipped\\nwith Apple Metal silicon, NVIDIA, AMD, or other edge-\\naccelerated hardware. Overall, we envision a world\\nwhere anyone, anywhere, with any machine, can access\\nand contribute to the cutting edge of AI.\\nLimitations\\nBy enabling access to large language models, the\\nGPT4All project also inherits many of the ethical con-\\ncerns associated with generative models. Principal\\namong these is the concern that unfiltered language\\nmodels like GPT4All enable malicious users to generate\\ncontent that could be harmful and dangerous (e.g., in-\\nstructions on building bioweapons). While we recognize\\nthis risk, we also acknowledge the risk of concentrating\\nthis technology in the hands of a limited number of in-\\ncreasingly secretive research groups. We believe that\\nthe risk of focusing on the benefits of language model\\ntechnology significantly outweighs the risk of misuse,\\nand hence we prefer to make the technology as widely\\navailable as possible.\\nFinally, we realize the challenge in assigning credit\\nfor large-scale open source initiatives. We make a first\\nattempt at fair credit assignment by explicitly includ-\\ning the GPT4All open source developers as authors on\\nthis work, but recognize that this is insufficient fully\\ncharacterize everyone involved in the GPT4All effort.\\nFurthermore, we acknowledge the difficulty in citing\\nopen source works that do not necessarily have standard-\\nized citations, and do our best in this paper to provide\\nURLs to projects whenever possible. We encourage\\nfurther research in the area of open source credit as-\\nsignment, and hope to be able to support some of this\\nresearch ourselves in the future. References\\nNomic AI. 2023.

Despite the popularity of the release , the GPT - 4 technical report OpenAI , 2023 ) contained virtually no details regarding the architecture , hard - ware , training compute , dataset construction , or training method used to create the model . Moreover , users could only access the model through the internet interface at chat . openai . com , which was severely rate limited and unavailable in several locales e . g . Italy ) BBC News , 2023 ). Additionally , GPT - 4 refused to answer a wide ∗ Shared Senior Authorship variety of queries , responding only with the now infa - mous As an AI Language Model , I cannot ...\" prefix Vincent , 2023 ). These transparency and accessibility concerns spurred several developers to begin creating open source large language model LLM ) alternatives . Several grassroots efforts focused on fine tuning Meta ’ s open code LLaMA model Touvron et al ., 2023 ; McMil - lan , 2023 ), whose weights were leaked on BitTorrent less than a week prior to the release of GPT - 4 Verge , 2023 ). GPT4All started as one of these variants . In this paper , we tell the story of GPT4All . We com - ment on the technical details of the original GPT4All model Anand et al ., 2023 ), as well as the evolution of GPT4All from a single model to an ecosystem of several models . We remark on the impact that the project has had on the open source community , and discuss future directions . It is our hope that this paper acts as both a technical overview of the original GPT4All models as well as a case study on the subsequent growth of the GPT4All open source ecosystem . 2 The Original GPT4All Model 2 . 1 Data Collection and Curation To train the original GPT4All model , we collected roughly one million prompt - response pairs using the GPT - 3 . 5 - Turbo OpenAI API between March 20 , 2023 and March 26th , 2023 . In particular , we gathered GPT - 3 . 5 - Turbo responses to prompts of three publicly avail - able datasets : the unified chip2 subset of LAION OIG , a random sub - sample of Stackoverflow Questions , and a sub - sample of Bigscience / P3 Sanh et al ., 2021 ). Fol - lowing the approach in Stanford Alpaca Taori et al ., 2023 ), an open source LLaMA variant that came just be - fore GPT4All , we focused substantial effort on dataset curation . The collected dataset was loaded into Atlas AI , 2023 )— a visual interface for exploring and tagging mas - sive unstructured datasets — for data curation . Using At - arXiv : 2311 . 04931v1 [ cs . CL ] 6 Nov 2023 las , we identified and removed subsets of the data where GPT - 3 . 5 - Turbo refused to respond , had malformed out - put , or produced a very short response . This resulted in the removal of the entire Bigscience / P3 subset of our data , as many P3 prompts induced responses that were simply one word . After curation , we were left with a set of 437 , 605 prompt - response pairs , which we visualize in Figure 1a . 2 . 2 Model Training The original GPT4All model was a fine tuned variant of LLaMA 7B . In order to train it more efficiently , we froze the base weights of LLaMA , and only trained a small set of LoRA Hu et al ., 2021 ) weights during the fine tuning process . Detailed model hyper - parameters and training code can be found in our associated code repository1 . 2 . 3 Model Access We publicly released all data , training code , and model weights for the community to build upon . Further , we provided a 4 - bit quantized version of the model , which enabled users to run it on their own commodity hard - ware without transferring data to a 3rd party service . Our research and development costs were dominated by ∼$ 800 in GPU spend rented from Lambda Labs and Paperspace ) and ∼$ 500 in OpenAI API spend . Our final GPT4All model could be trained in about eight hours on a Lambda Labs DGX A100 8x 80GB for a total cost of ∼$ 100 . 2 . 4 Model Evaluation We performed a preliminary evaluation of our model using the human evaluation data from the Self Instruct paper Wang et al ., 2023 ). We reported the ground truth perplexity of our model against what was , to our knowl - edge , the best openly available alpaca - lora model at the time , provided by user chainyo on HuggingFace . Both models had very large perplexities on a small number of tasks , so we reported perplexities clipped to a maximum of 100 . We found that GPT4All produces stochastically lower ground truth perplexities than alpaca - lora Anand et al ., 2023 ). 3 From a Model to an Ecosystem 3 . 1 GPT4All - J : Repository Growth and the implications of the LLaMA License The GPT4All repository grew rapidly after its release , gaining over 20000 GitHub stars in just one week , as shown in Figure 2 . This growth was supported by an in - person hackathon hosted in New York City three days after the model release , which attracted several hundred participants . As the Nomic discord , the home of online discussion about GPT4All , ballooned to over 10000 people , one thing became very clear - there was massive demand for a model that could be used commercially . 1https :// github . com / nomic - ai / gpt4all The LLaMA model that GPT4All was based on was licensed for research only , which severely limited the set of domains that GPT4All could be applied in . As a response to this , the Nomic team repeated the model training procedure of the original GPT4All model , but based on the already open source and commercially li - censed GPT - J model Wang and Komatsuzaki , 2021 ). GPT4All - J also had an augmented training set , which contained multi - turn QA examples and creative writing such as poetry , rap , and short stories . The creative writ - ing prompts were generated by filling in schemas such as Write a [ CREATIVE STORY TYPE ] about [ NOUN ] in the style of [ PERSON ].\" We again employed Atlas to curate the prompt - response pairs in this data set . Our evaluation methodology also evolved as the project grew . In particular , we began evaluating GPT4All models using a suite of seven reasoning tasks that were used for evaluation of the Databricks Dolly Conover et al ., 2023b ) model , which was re - leased on April 12 , 2023 . Unfortunately , GPT4All - J did not outperform other prominent open source models on this evaluation . As a result , we endeavoured to create a model that did . 3 . 2 GPT4All - Snoozy : the Emergence of the GPT4All Ecosystem GPT4All - Snoozy was developed using roughly the same procedure as the previous GPT4All models , but with a few key modifications . First , GPT4All - Snoozy used the LLaMA - 13B base model due to its superior base metrics procedure as the previous GPT4All models , but with a few key modifications . First , GPT4All - Snoozy used the LLaMA - 13B base model due to its superior base metrics when compared to GPT - J . Next , GPT4All - Snoozy incor - porated the Dolly ’ s training data into its train mix . After data curation and deduplication with Atlas , this yielded a training set of 739 , 259 total prompt - response pairs . We dubbed the model that resulted from training on this improved dataset GPT4All - Snoozy . As shown in Figure 1 , GPT4All - Snoozy had the best average score on our evaluation benchmark of any model in the ecosystem at the time of its release . Concurrently with the development of GPT4All , sev - eral organizations such as LMSys , Stability AI , BAIR , and Databricks built and deployed open source language models . We heard increasingly from the community that they wanted quantized versions of these models for local use . As we realized that organizations with ever more resources were developing source language models , we decided to pivot our effort away from training increas - ingly capable models and towards providing easy access to the plethora of models being produced by the open source community . Practically , this meant spending our time compressing open source models for use on com - modity hardware , providing stable and simple high level model APIs , and supporting a GUI for no code model experimentation . 3 . 3 The Current State of GPT4All Today , GPT4All is focused on improving the accessi - bility of open source language models .

OpenAI ’ s text - davinci - 003 is included as a point of comparison . The best overall performing model in the GPT4All ecosystem , Nous - Hermes2 , achieves over 92 of the average performance of text - davinci - 003 . Models marked with an asterisk were available in the ecosystem as of the release of GPT4All - Snoozy . Note that at release , GPT4All - Snoozy had the best average performance of any model in the ecosystem . Bolded numbers indicate the best performing model as of August 1 , 2023 . Figure 2 : Comparison of the github start growth of GPT4All , Meta ’ s LLaMA , and Stanford ’ s Alpaca . We conjecture that GPT4All achieved and maintains faster ecosystem growth due to the focus on access , which allows more users to meaningfully participate . provides compressed versions of open source models for use on commodity hardware , stable and simple high level model APIs , and a GUI for no code model ex - perimentation . The project continues to increase in popularity , and as of August 1 2023 , has garnered over 50000 GitHub stars and over 5000 forks . GPT4All currently provides native support and benchmark data for over 35 models see Figure 1 ), and includes several models co - developed with industry part - ners such as Replit and Hugging Face . GPT4All also provides high level model APIs in languages includ - ing Python , Typescript , Go , C #, and Java , among oth - ers . Furthermore , the GPT4All no code GUI currently supports the workflows of over 50000 monthly active users , with over 25 of users coming back to the tool every day of the week . Note that all GPT4All user data is collected on an opt inbasis .) GPT4All has be - come the top language model integration in the popular open source AI orchestration library LangChain Chase , 2022 ), and powers many popular open source projects such as PrivateGPT imartinez , 2023 ), Quiver StanGi - rard , 2023 ), and MindsDB MindsDB , 2023 ), among others . GPT4All is the 3rd fastest growing GitHub repository of all time Leo , 2023 ), and is the 185th most popular repository on the platform , by star count . 4 The Future of GPT4All In the future , we will continue to grow GPT4All , sup - porting it as the de facto solution for LLM accessibil - ity . Concretely , this means continuing to compress and distribute important open - source language models de - veloped by the community , as well as compressing and distributing increasingly multimodal AI models . Fur - thermore , we will expand the set of hardware devices that GPT4All models run on , so that GPT4All models “ just work on any machine , whether it comes equipped with Apple Metal silicon , NVIDIA , AMD , or other edge - accelerated hardware . Overall , we envision a world where anyone , anywhere , with any machine , can access and contribute to the cutting edge of AI . Limitations By enabling access to large language models , the GPT4All project also inherits many of the ethical con - cerns associated with generative models . Principal among these is the concern that unfiltered language models like GPT4All enable malicious users to generate content that could be harmful and dangerous e . g ., in - structions on building bioweapons ). While we recognize this risk , we also acknowledge the risk of concentrating this technology in the hands of a limited number of in - creasingly secretive research groups . We believe that the risk of focusing on the benefits of language model technology significantly outweighs the risk of misuse , and hence we prefer to make the technology as widely available as possible . Finally , we realize the challenge in assigning credit for large - scale open source initiatives . We make a first attempt at fair credit assignment by explicitly includ - ing the GPT4All open source developers as authors on this work , but recognize that this is insufficient fully characterize everyone involved in the GPT4All effort . Furthermore , we acknowledge the difficulty in citing open source works that do not necessarily have standard - ized citations , and do our best in this paper to provide URLs to projects whenever possible . We encourage further research in the area of open source credit as - signment , and hope to be able to support some of this research ourselves in the future . References Nomic AI . 2023 .
